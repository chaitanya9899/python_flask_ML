# The problem that I'm getting:
To stay updated in "Machine Learning/Data Science/ Artificial Intelligence" I read 2 blogs every day. 
But finding a good article is really tough. for this, I've to go through many websites in order to get a good article.
As I know I'm really lazy. I don't want to go through every website one by one.

# How did I solve it:
So I've listed out all the blogs (Website) that I read the most, 
and then I scrape them and made my own personal website. 
In which I don't have to go through every website to read the blog.
I can read them all on my website
